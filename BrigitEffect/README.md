# BrigitEffect
Generated by **Brigit Framework**.

## Type
**Effect** Plugin

## One Code, All Platforms.
This project compiles to both a **YMM4 Plugin** (Managed) and an **AviUtl Plugin** (Native).

## How to Build

### 1. Build for YMM4
```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```
Output: `bin/Release/net10.0/BrigitEffect.dll`

### 2. Build for AviUtl (NativeAOT)
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 /p:NativeLib=Shared /p:SelfContained=true
```
Output: `bin/Release/net10.0/win-x64/publish/BrigitEffect.dll` -> Rename to `BrigitEffect.auf` (or .auo/.auc) for AviUtl.

## Development
Edit `Plugin.cs`. The logic there is shared (simulated for now) or bridged to both platforms.
